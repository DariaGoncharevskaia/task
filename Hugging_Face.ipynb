And no Muslim country was doing\\nmuch of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi\\nArabia; indeed, in some masses of citizens were demonstrating\\nin favor of that butcher Saddam (who killed lotsa Muslims),\\njust because he was killing, raping, and looting relatively\\nrich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West.\\n\\nSo how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolled\\nback the Iraqi invasion, were you in charge of Saudi Arabia???\\n\\n\\nI think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an\\nofficial religion (de facto or de jure), because with human nature\\nlike it is, the ambitious and not the pious will always be the\\nones who rise to power.  There are just too many people in this\\nworld (or any country) for the citizens to really know if a \\nleader is really devout or if he is just a slick operator.\\n\\n\\nYou make it sound like these guys are angels, Ilyess.  (In your\\nclarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???)\\nFriday's New York Times reported that this group definitely is\\nmore conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who\\nthink that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively\\nenough).  The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the\\ngovernment was not conservative enough, they have:\\n\\n\\t- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom\\n\\t  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law\\n\\t  brings the death penalty.  \\n\\n\\t  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess?\\n\\n\\t- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who\\n\\t  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on\\n\\t  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,\\n\\t  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should\\n\\t  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as\\n\\t  prostitutes.\\n\\n\\t  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I've\\n\\t  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving\\n\\t  has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc.\\n\\t  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want\\n\\t  these women falsely called prostitutes?  \\n\\n\\t  If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely,\\n\\t  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind\\n\\t  anyone who hates anyone you hate.\\n\\n\\t- say that women should not be allowed to work.\\n\\n\\t- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.\\n\\nNow, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government\\non earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among\\nother things.  I just think that the most likely replacements\\nfor them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.\\nBut I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the\\nlast six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing\\nby the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women\\nnot fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it\\nsends the wrong signals about your morality).

So the\\ngovernment has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of\\nthe wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition.\\nAs unislamic as some of these things are, they're just a small\\ntaste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of\\nSaud, like they're trying to in the long run.\\n\\nIs this really what you (and Rached and others in the general\\nwest-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd)\\nwant, Ilyess?\\n\",\n",

The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  \\nIndeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic \\nmycosis.\"  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic \\ninfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or \\n\"sick\" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent \\nparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.\\nYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute \\nit.\\n\\nWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic \\ninfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \\ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \\nblooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser\\'s again: \"However, some factors, such as \\nthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to \\nboth mucosal and systemic infections\".  I was addressing mucosal infections\\n(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers \\nthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the \"cure\".  I guess that \\nyour nutrition course does not, too bad.  \\n\\n\\n\\nMy, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you \\nnoticed my faculty rank, I\\'m a biochemist, not a microbiologist.\\nCandida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser\\'s).  But, as you point \\nout, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, \\npseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist \\nand that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it\\'s a lot of \\nGreek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.\\n\\nYou know Elisabeth, I still haven\\'t been able to figure out why such a small \\nlittle organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in \\nSci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too.\\nI keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what \\nI\\'ve said, that it will make sense.

This page\\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,\\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \\n(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this\\npage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get\\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\\narea in question.\\n   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.\\nThe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \\nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\\neditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should\\nbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the \\nunderstanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.\\n   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have\\na stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular\\nnumber can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation\\nright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your\\ncolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the\\ncontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.\\nA special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh\\nideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.\\n   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)\\nand particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.\\nYou can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.\\nOn the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual\\nreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing\\nin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.\\n   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.\\nYou can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete\\npapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received\\nseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,\\nRussia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed\\ntexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact\\nperson (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,\\nyou will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning\\nour common interest and job.\\n\\nAt the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in\\nevery mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various\\npossibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and \\nphilosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,\\nand on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give\\nproposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail\\nand by other means.\\n\\nSincerely yours,\",\n",

              " '\\nBosnian Muslims are citizens od Bosnia-Herzegovina who identify themselves\\nwith Bosnian Muslim cultural and religious tradition.\\n\\n\\nIn Bosnia, \"Muslim\" is not merely a religious category, but an ethnic\\none as well.  Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments\\nmade by people on this subject:\\n\\n(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims\\n    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.\\n\\n(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel\\n    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.\\n\\nIn 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,\\nand (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if\\nBosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\\nTurkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\\nclue what was their ancestor\\'s actual nationality.  In fact, although\\nBosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national\\nallegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and\\nhistoric identity.  So, arguments like \"yes, but your ancestors were\\nCroats or Serbs\" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what\\ntheir ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel\\nthat they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.\\nWhat outsiders say is simply not relevant.\\n\\n\\nIn the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when \"Muslim nationality\"\\nappeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result\\nof a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing\\n\"Bosniaks\" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)\\ndeclaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement \\nof this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of\\n\"Muslim nationality\" choice in census forms.\\n\\nFor comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories\\navailable to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:\\n\\nSerb-Muslims:                        71,991\\nCroat-Muslims:                       25,295\\nMuslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403\\n\\nThis clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own\\nnationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat\\nnationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have\\nconsistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose \"undeclared\",\\nin 1953 they chose \"Yugoslavs\", in 1961 both \"Yugoslavs\" and \"Bosniak \\nethnic group\", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose \"Muslim nationality\".\\n\\nPerhaps the term \"Bosnian Muslim nationality\" is too confusing for\\nthe rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking\\nabout Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some\\nseparate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and\\ncultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,\\nbecause the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political\\nfanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival\\ndominate people\\'s thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,\\nBosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime\\nas it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.',\n",

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were\\nperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43\\n(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results \\nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\\n\\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\\n\\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\\n\\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\\n\\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\\nmini-sequence.\\n\\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 203 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.

Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above\\nor below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from \\nthe mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.\\nIn the four years (\\'84-\\'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there\\nwere 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch \\nsituations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of\\nthose 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two\\nyears.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and\\nreally horrible the other year.

Within hours, the    \\ncompound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.\\n   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them\\nwho are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the \\nsix said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    \\nsince Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's \\nphone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the\\ncults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.\\n    They kept their word.

Strapped into gas masks, the\\nwomen did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all\\nunder 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    \\nwas happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building\\nit shook violently.

The gas began filling the air,\\ndriven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks\\nmade. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to\\ngather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle\\nheaded for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to \\nfind Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.\\n  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The\\nFBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult\\nmembers, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions\\nat odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of \\npropane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,\\nit tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and\\nother flammables.

Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he\\nallowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you\\nshould get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third\\nperiod.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they\\nwould not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular\\ngoalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they\\nare occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like\\nSakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there \\nare any legitimate excuses. \\n\\n\\nI am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a\\nrelatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result \\nin a goal. \\n\\n\\nIn a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as\\n'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty\\neither...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal\\nonly, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second \\ngoal.\\n\\n\\nWhat you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the \\ngame was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you\\ncould watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what\\nif's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final\\nresult is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and\\nemail you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive\\nscrewups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie\\nis the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is\\nfocussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*\\ngoal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally\\nunrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if\\nyou're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key\\nsaves at the key times.\\n\\n\\nFor the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in\\nthe league.  In fact, I agree that he is.\\n\\n                            \\nI assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think\\nthe loss can be blamed on Roy.
